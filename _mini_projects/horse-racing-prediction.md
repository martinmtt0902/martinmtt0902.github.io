This project analyzes Hong Kong horse racing data and compares modern machine learning
methods for predicting race outcomes.

The dataset contains over 130,000 race records extracted from public racing databases,
including:

- horse demographics  
- race characteristics  
- jockey/trainer statistics  
- track & turf conditions  
- sectional time information

The project evaluates and compares:

### **Models evaluated**
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
- **Logistic Regression (baseline)**

### **Key findings**
- Random Forest achieved the highest out-of-sample accuracy among classical methods.
- Deep Neural Networks performed competitively but required heavy tuning.
- Feature importance revealed consistency in jockey, trainer, and horse form variables.
- Odds-based features significantly improved predictive performance.

### **Files included in the repo**
- Data cleaning scripts  
- Feature engineering pipeline  
- Model training notebooks  
- Evaluation metrics & comparison plots
