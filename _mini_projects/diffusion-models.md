This project compares the performance of major **diffusion probabilistic model (DPM)** samplers including DDPM, DDIM, DPM-Solver, DPM-Solver++ and UniPC under a given target distribution.

### Highlights
- Derived the exact **score function** for VP diffusion of a GMM  
- Implemented five samplers in R  
- Compared sampling quality (FID), computational efficiency, and robustness  
- Studied high-dimensional performance (2D → 100D)
