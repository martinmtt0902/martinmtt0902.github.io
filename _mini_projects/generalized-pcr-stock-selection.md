This project implements a generalized principal component regression (PCR) approach
to stock selection using high-dimensional factor ratios and PCA-based compression.

- Implemented in **R**
- Reads Bloomberg equity factor data (kept private) and runs a generalized PCR
  pipeline to estimate stock returns.
- Compares PCR-based models with standard regression baselines.
