R implementation of robust risk assessment based on **F-divergences**, reproducing
and extending experiments from *“A Toolkit for Robust Risk Assessment Using
F-Divergences”*.

- Implements lognormal and Weibull reference models.
- Provides functions to estimate worst-case expectations under divergence constraints.
- Includes simulation studies (inventory pooling, dependence via copulas) and an
  application to Hong Kong COVID-19 case counts.
