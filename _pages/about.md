I am a PhD student in Statistics in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) at  
[The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/).  
My background includes Statistics, Mathematics, and Finance.

My research interests include change-point detection in non-stationary high-frequency financial data and non-parametric statistics.  
I am also keen on inference for time series data.
